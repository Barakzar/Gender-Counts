How Gender Counts When Couples Count Their Money1
Francine M. Deutsch,2,3 Josipa Roksa,2 and Cynthia Meeske2
In this study we explored the ways in which men’s and women’s personal incomes are treated
and experienced differently in the family. Two hundred and fourteen participants (102 men
and 112 women) in dual-earner couples were recruited in a random sample telephone survey.
Participants reported a double standard in which women receive more praise than men for
their incomes. Men reported stronger negative and positive feelings about their incomes than
women. Regardless of gender, the higher the participants’ income category the more gratitude
they received from spouses and the more appreciated they felt. Wives’ absolute incomes
elicited husbands’ gratitude, whereas husbands’ relative incomes influenced wives’ gratitude.
Women who outearned their husbands reported no negative consequences. Although money
still carries gendered meaning, women’s incomes may earn increasing clout in the family. The
ways in which praise, criticism, and gratitude for earnings provide a window on how gender is
done and undone in the family are discussed.
KEYWORDS: double standard; breadwinner; appreciation; economy of gratitude.
West and Zimmerman (1987) theorized that gender
does not reside within individual identities or in
internalized roles, but is “accomplished” in social interaction.
Theorists have argued, for example, that the
persistent gender inequality in the division of household
labor, which appears irrational given the increase
in women’s labor force participation, makes sense if
we consider the household a site at which gender is
produced along with household goods and services.
By doing a disproportionate share of the household
chores, women demonstrate their “essential natures
as women,” just as men demonstrate their “essential
natures as men” by refraining from household labor
(Brines, 1993, 1994a, 1994b;Fenstermaker Berk, 1985;
Fenstermaker, West, & Zimmerman, 1991; West &
Fenstermaker, 1993).
Likewise, men and women “do gender” through
maintaining different stances toward the labor

market. Because the “good provider” role has been
tied to conceptions of masculinity for over 100 years
(Bernard, 1981), men have a different relation to
money than women do. Men may accept women’s labor
force participation but still prefer to earn more
than their wives or at least, not to rely on their
wives’ incomes (Zuo, 1997). One study (Crowley,
1998) showed that when husbands perceived that they
were unable to support their families without the
assistance of wives, they were more depressed, and
had more conflict-ridden marriages than men who
did not perceive themselves as “inadequate breadwinners”
(p. 14). Husbands and wives typically prioritize
husbands’ jobs over wives’ jobs (Zvokovic, Greaves,
Schmiege,&Hall, 1996). In families where wives’ jobs
are considered the more important job in the family,
couples often tried to hide their financial arrangements
from others, and sometimes even lied about
them outright (Atkinson & Boles, 1984).
Couples also “do gender” by conferring different
meanings on wives’ than on husbands’ incomes.
When women earn money, it is often not
conceptualized as providing for their families. In the
majority of dual-earner families, women are not considered
coproviders (Hood, 1983; Perry-Jenkins &
291 0360-0025/03/0400-0291/0 C° 2003 Plenum Publishing Corporation
292 Deutsch, Roksa, and Meeske
Crouter, 1990; Perry-Jenkins, Seery, & Crouter, 1992;
Potuchek, 1997). Couples maintain that wives are
merely helping rather than assuming responsibility for
breadwinning (Hood, 1986). When wives contribute
a substantial percentage of family income, couples
may deny that wives’ incomes are necessary and, at
least in theory, they keep open the option for wives to
leave the labor force (Hood, 1983). In working class
families, where it’s harder to deny the necessity of
wives’ incomes, women may believe they have a responsibility
to “help” husbands provide for their families,
but usually still consider themselves to be secondary
providers (Rosen, 1987; Zavella, 1987). Even
when men are unemployed, husbands and wives may
deny that the wife is the provider (Zvokovic et al.,
1996).
One strategy couples often use to downplay the
importance of women’s earnings is to earmark them
for nonessentials or “extras” (Hood, 1983; Potuchek,
1997; Thompson & Walker, 1989). However, sometimes
the so-called “extras” are actually essential.
For example, Hood (1986) reported on a couple in
which the wife’s income, clearly defined as secondary,
“only” went toward mortgage payments.Women’s incomes
are also trivialized by the practice of deducting
childcare expenses from them before the incomes are
counted as contributions to the family (Hertz, 1992).
The practice of treating women’s incomes as
“special monies” has a long history. Zelizer (1989)
reported that in the nineteenth and early twentieth
century, when women earned money by extending domestic
labor (e.g., taking boarders into their homes)
the money was merged with housekeeping money,
which rendered it invisible. And when farm wives
earned money through the production of butter and
eggs, “butter and egg money” was spent differently
than the “corn and wheat” money brought in by farm
husbands.
Money and Power
Money confers power in the family. Women
who earn relatively more of the family income than
other women have more influence in decisions, do
a smaller percentage of domestic labor, and have
their careers treated as relatively more important
(Izraeli, 1994; John & Shelton, 1997; Kamo, 1988;
Steil, 1997). Some theorists have gone as far as to
suggest that the power difference between men and
women in the family is entirely attributable to men’s
higher incomes [see Coltrane’s discussion (Coltrane,
1996) of relative resource theory], which implies
that money is gender-neutral. In a more nuanced
theoretical position, Blumberg and Coleman (1989)
acknowledged the importance of both absolute and
relative (to the spouse) earnings in conferring power,
but argued that the value of money contributed in
the family could be diminished by “discount” factors,
such as gender ideology.
Gender itself might operate as a discount factor.
Women’s incomes do not seem to confer the
same advantages in the family that men’s do. For
example, women who outearn their husbands are
not more likely to say that their careers take precedence
in their families, although men who earn more
than their wives do say that their careers are more
valued (Steil, 1997; Steil & Weltman, 1991). Moreover,
women’s dollars don’t buy as much relief from
domestic labor as men’s do. When men significantly
outearn their wives, those wives do most of the domestic
labor in their households, but when women
outearn husbands, the most men take on is an equal
share of chores (Atkinson & Boles, 1984; Izraeli,
1994; Tichenor, 1999). Some studies even suggest that
women compensate for outearning their husbands by
taking on more domestic labor (Biernat &Wortman,
1991; Brines, 1993, 1994a, 1994b; Deutsch, Lussier, &
Servis, 1993; Hochschild, 1989).
Gender also discounts decision-making power
in the family. Although outearning wives may have
more power in family decisions than other women,
they don’t use money-based power with impunity.
Regardless of relative earnings, women use persuasion
to get their way, whereas husbands sometimes
resort to ultimatums and vetoes. Even when an outearning
wife seems to shape family decisions, it is not
attributed to her superior earnings, but to her planning,
organizational, or management skills (Tichenor,
1999).Women are reluctant to emphasize their superior
earnings and may go out of their way to communicate
that outearning their husbands does not entitle
them to special privileges as wives (Atkinson &
Boles, 1984; Tichenor, 1999). Thus, although men and
womenboth seemoneyas a symbol of power, prestige,
and success, it is a more direct, undisguised source of
power for men than for women (Prince, 1993). Men’s
use of monetary power along with women’s inability
to use monetary power or their restraint in its use,
produce and reproduce gender.
Praise and Criticism
A double standard of praise and criticism for
men’s and women’s family roles has been documented
How Gender Counts 293
previously. Women and men who deviate from
gendered norms are both praised and criticized by
people outside the family more than women and
men who adhere to those norms (Deutsch, 1999;
Deutsch&Saxon, 1998). Fathers are more likely than
mothers to be criticized if they pass up a night out
with their friends to spend time with their children
or if they leave work to tend to a sick child. Mothers
are more likely than fathers to be criticized if they
are employed full time or if their children are in day
care. Fathers are also praised much more than mothers
for taking care of their children. As one father put
it: “I change one diaper, I’m a hero—man of the 90’s,”
(Deutsch, 1999, p. 94).
These different responses to the behavior of men
and women reflect that stereotypes can result in the
“shifting standards” identified by Biernat and her
colleagues (Biernat, Vescio, & Manis, 1998). In a
series of studies, they demonstrated that when the
performance of the target’s group was expected to
be inferior, lower standards for evaluation were applied
(Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1999). For example,
women were rated financially successful at a lower
income than were men (Biernat, Manis, & Nelson,
1991), Black men were evaluated more positively
than White men in a simulated job interview if the
two groups had the same leadership qualifications
(Biernat & Kobrynowicz, 1997), and fathers who described
themselves as “good fathers” were assumed
to perform fewer positive parenting behaviors than
mothers who described themselves as “good mothers”
(Kobrynowicz & Biernat, 1997). Shifting standards
can explain the double standard of both praise
and criticism for mothers and fathers, but whether
evaluators praise or criticize depends on their opinion
about whether the deviation from the stereotype
is good or bad.
Praise and criticism provide a mechanism for
making normative gendered expectations salient. The
gender construction model argues that we “do gender”
by managing our conduct in light of these normative
expectations (West & Zimmerman, 1987).When
men and women contest gender, onlookers notice and
express either approval or disapproval, which highlights
that the behavior is nonnormative.
However, there is one puzzling exception to the
pattern that contesting gender elicits praise or criticism.
Neither men nor women report praise for earning
money. If men earn excessive praise for occasionally
pushing a baby in a stroller, why don’t women
merit the same kind of praise for their earnings? We
know that women are considered more financially
successful than men if they earn the same amount of
money (Biernat et al., 1991). In the 150 dual-earner
couples the first author interviewed for a recent study,
33 women earned as much or more than their husbands,
yet none of them reported praise for their earnings(
Deutsch, 1999). None of their husbands reported
being told how lucky they were to have wives who
contributed so much to the family income, whereas
women were routinely told how lucky they were to
have husbands who did a lot of childcare. Because
succeeding as a man means providing well for his
family, drawing attention to a wife’s income may be
tantamount to questioning her husband’s masculinity.
Praise for women’s earnings may simply be taboo
(Deutsch, 1999; Deutsch & Saxon, 1998).
The Economy of Gratitude
Arlie Hochschild (1989) coined the term
“economy of gratitude” to describe the value of exchanged
“gifts” between husbands and wives. Husbands
and wives exchange gratitude based on their
own stances toward gendered norms and how their
spouses’ behavior shapes up according to those norms.
Thus, we would expect that husbands and wives who
endorse traditional norms would tend to be grateful
to their spouses for “traditional” behavior (i.e., childcare
by women, breadwinning by men), whereas nontraditional
husbands and wives would be more grateful
to spouses whose behavior contests those norms
(i.e., childcare by men, breadwinning by women).
However, among couples who agree in their opinions
of gendered norms, we would expect more gratitude
expressed when spouses contest rather than conform
to norms because the nontraditional behavior
is not taken-for-granted the way normative behavior
would be.
The patterns of gratitude that emerge among
couples reflect not only gendered norms, but changing
responses to those norms, and ultimately, changes in
the norms themselves. For example, if overall, wives
are more grateful for husbands’ contributions to childcare
than husbands are for wives’ contributions, it suggests
both that childcare is nonnormative for men and
that at least some women want to contest that gendered
norm. In contrast, if husbands are ungrateful
for wives’ incomes, it suggests that gendered norms for
breadwinning are less contested than those for childcare.
If, however, husbands are more grateful for their
wives’ incomes than wives are for their husbands’ incomes,
it suggests that although breadwinning is still
nonnormative for women, gendered norms for breadwinning
may be changing.

Changing Gendered Norms
In a longitudinal study of attitudes toward family
and work, Willinger (1993) compared attitudes of
male college seniors in 1980, 1985, and 1990. Over that
decade fewer and fewer men reported feeling uncomfortable
with a wife who outearned them. By 1990,
59% of the men surveyed reported that it wouldn’t
bother them at all if their wives earned more money,
and only 7% reported that they would feel very uncomfortable.
Likewise, men professed more support
for wives’ career advancement by 1990, even when it
meant a geographical move.
In the late 1980s, Potuchek (1997) interviewed
couples about the meaning of their earnings in the
family, and found that only 16% of the women and
36% of the men she interviewed considered themselves
and their spouses fully coproviders. When the
same couples were interviewed again 5 years later
in the early 1990s, 28% of the women and 40% of
the men considered themselves coproviders. Likewise,
in Perry-Jenkins’s research on provider-role attitudes,
a sizeable minority in her sample of 43 couples
thought that they had equal responsibility for supporting
the family financially (Perry-Jenkins & Crouter,
1990; Perry-Jenkins, Seery, & Crouter, 1992). Even
in Atkinson and Boles’s earlier study (Atkinson &
Boles, 1984) of “status-reversed” couples, husbands
acknowledged benefits they accrued through their
wives’ earnings, such as the freedom to pursue other
interests without the pressure of providing for the
family. Some of the men reported pride in their wives’
career success.
As we enter the twenty-first century, the sheer
force of women’s increasing contributions to family
income should debunk the myth that women’s earnings
are peripheral to families’ economic well-being.
The percentage of women who outearn their husbands
is rising (Winkler, 1998). In 1981, only 15.9% of
married women in dual-earner households outearned
their husbands, but by 2000, that figure had risen
to 22.5% (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Zuo (1997)
showed that the greater the percentage of family income
earned by their wives, the more men’s gender
attitudes (including attitudes about providing for the
family) changed toward egalitarianism over time.
The Current Study
In the current study we further explored how
gender counts when people count their money. We
examined both gratitude exchanged between husbands
and wives inside the family, as well as the praise
and criticism received for earnings from both inside
and outside the family. We hypothesized that if attitudes
toward wives’ earnings are changing, husbands
would be more grateful for wives’ incomes than wives
are for husbands’ incomes, and women should receive
more praise and criticism for their incomes from outside
the family than men do.
METHOD
Participants
A total of 214 people (102 men and 112 women)
participated in the study. Only individuals in dualearner
couples with children living at home were eligible
to participate. Both the participant and his/her
spouse had to be working at least 20 hr per week in
paid labor. The mean age for both men and women
was 40 years; the range was 27–65 years old. The
mean number of children was 2.11. Men reported
contributing a mean of 39.44% of the parenting in
their families; women reported a mean of 65.50%,
t(211) = 13.32, p < .001. We did not ask the participants’
race so the racial composition of the sample
is unknown. On the basis of 2000 census data,
each of the four towns surveyed has a population
that is at least 94% White (Pioneer Valley Planning
Commission, 2000). Fifty percent of the women and
58% of the men had at least graduated from college.
On the basis of the 120 people who answered
the question “How much do you earn per year?”
the median income reported by women was $26,000
(range was $5,000–$100,000); the median for men
was $44,000 (the range was $10,000–$100,000), which
was significantly different, Â
2(1) = 20.85, p < .001.
All the participants answered a more general question
about their income categories, in which they indicated
whether they earned less than $15,000, between
$15,000 and $25,000, between $25,000 and $50,000, or
more than $50,000. For both men and women, the
modal category was 25–50 thousand dollars. About
half of the incomes fell into that category. Most of
the rest of the men in the sample earned more than
$50,000, whereas most of the rest of thewomenearned
less than $25,000. On the basis of this income category
data as well, men earned more than women,
Â
2(3) = 43.45, p < .001.
Twelve undergraduate female interviewers, who
were all participating in research courses, contacted
How Gender Counts 295
a total of 3,721 households in a random sample
telephone survey of four communities in Western
Massachusetts (all within a no cost dialing zone). Initially,
we used random digit dialing, but because of the
high number of nonresidential calls and phones out of
order, we switched to random selection of pages of the
relevant telephone books. We alternated asking husbands
and wives in different families to participate.
About 40% of the families contacted were not eligible
and another one-third of the total sample could
not be reached.4 Of the remaining 957 families, who
were both eligible and reached, 743 refused to participate
and 214 agreed, yielding a response rate of 22%.
However, some of those who refused to participate
were probably not eligible anyway, which deflated the
response rate.
Procedure
In the fall of 1998 and the spring of 1999 participants
were contacted by telephone and asked if they
would be willing to participate in a study of life in dualearner
families. After they agreed and we established
their eligibility, they completed a 15-min telephone
interview.
The data collected for this study were part of a
larger study on double standards for men and women
in dual-earner couples, thus the interview also included
questions on leisure that will not be discussed
here. The questions relevant to the current study focused
on earned income and parenting.
Questions assessed the participants’ earnings and
their spouses’ earnings. Because we thought that people
might be reluctant to reveal precise income information,
they were first asked “How much do you earn
per year?” and then, if unwilling to answer, were asked
to classify themselves for “categorization” purposes
into one of four income categories, which ranged from
under $14,999 to over $50,000.5 They also indicated
whether their spouses made more, less, or the same
income. We asked whether they had ever received
praise or criticism from either their spouse or anyone
else for their financial contributions to the family,
as well as how much their spouses appreciated their
financial contributions and how grateful they felt to
their spouses for the spouses’ financial contributions.
4Interviewers made five attempts to reach a number before categorizing
it as “no answer.”
5Unwillingness to answer the precise question “How much do you
earn per year?” did not differ between men and women or across
income categories.
The latter two questions were answered on 7-point
scales, which ranged from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very).
Participants also rated how happy, frustrated, embarrassed,
and proud they felt about their financial contributions
to the family on the same 7-point scales.
Participants estimated the percentage of parenting
that they contributed overall and the percentage
that their spouses contributed. They indicated
whether or not they had done each of the following
four childcare tasks within the past 24 hr: get up at
night with children, supervise children’s morning routine,
transport children, supervise children’s bedtime
routine. We asked if participants had received praise
or criticism about their parenting from anyone. If so,
we asked whether praise or criticism had come from
the spouse and/or someone outside the couple.
Finally, participants answered demographic
questions. They indicated their genders; their ages
and spouses’ ages; levels of education completed by
self and spouse; occupations; number of hours in paid
work per week; and number, age, and genders of
children.
RESULTS
Praise and Criticism for Earning
To assess whether a double standard of praise and
criticism existed for income earned,weconducted chisquare
analyses that compared men’s and women’s
reports of whether they received any praise for their
earnings, any praise specifically from the spouse, any
praise from other people, any criticism for earnings,
any criticism specifically from spouse, and any criticism
from others. Figure 1 shows thatwomenreported
receiving more praise on each of the praise variables.
Overall, 58.2% of the women but only 32% of the
men reported any praise for their earnings in the family,
Â
2(1) = 14.23, p < .001. Fifty-four percent of the
women but only 30 percent of the men reported praise
from spouses, Â
2(1) = 12.60, p < .001. Twenty-eight
percent of the women but only 14 percent of the men
reported praise from people outside their immediate
family, Â
2(1) = 6.43, p < .05. These findings are particularly
remarkable given that the men in the sample
earned significantly more money than the women.
Criticism for earning was relatively rare. Only
15 participants (6%) reported criticism from any
source. Six men and nine women received criticism.
None of the chi-squares on gender differences in criticism
reported were significant.
296 Deutsch, Roksa, and Meeske
Fig. 1. Percentage of men and women reporting praise for earnings.
Next, we examined the relation between income
category and reported praise.6 For men, there was
no relation between income category and any praise
variable. For women, income category was significantly
related to reported praise overall, Â
2(3) =
8.79, p < .05, and praise from outside the family,
Â
2(3) = 9.36, p < .05, and marginally significantly related
to praise from the spouse, Â
2(3) = 6.86, p < .10.
The clearest pattern was that women in the lowest
income group, those who earned less than $15,000
per year, were less likely than other women to report
praise for their financial contributions. For example,
only 29% of the women who earned less
than $15,000 reported any praise, whereas of the
women in the other three income groups, 72%, 65%,
and 64%, respectively, reported praise from some
source. Because of the very small number of participants
who reported any criticism, no analyses were
conducted to compare criticism received by income
category.
6We used the income category variable rather than the continuous
measure of income in many analyses reported in this paper
because only 120 of the 214 participants answered the question
“How much money do you earn per year?,” whereas all of the
participants were willing to classify themselves into an income
category. Nonetheless, a parallel set of analyses were carried out
using the continuous income variable. In no case did the findings
contradict the results using the income category variable.
Appreciation and Gratitude for Earnings
We then conducted separate analyses of variance
to assess how participant income category, spouse income
category, and gender affected appreciation and
gratitude for earnings between husbands and wives.
Because only one male participant fell into the lowest
earning category, the lower two categories were collapsed
into one.Thus, the three remaining income categories
included under $25,000, between $25,000 and
$50,000, and over $50,000.A2 (gender of participant)
× 3 (participant’s income category) analysis of variance
on how much appreciation participants reported
from their spouses revealed a significant main effect of
gender, F(1, 194) = 9.85, p < .01, a significant main
effect for participant’s income category, F(2, 194) =
9.42, p < .001, and a marginally significant interaction
between gender and participant’s income category,
F(2, 194) = 2.64, p < .08. Wives felt more appreciated
for their earnings (M = 6.11) than husbands
did (M = 5.85). Participants who earned over $50,000
per year felt more appreciated (M = 6.29) than those
who earned between $25,000 and $50,000 (M = 6.08),
who, in turn, felt more appreciated than those who
earned under $25,000 (M = 5.44). Although the pattern
of less appreciation for lower earnings held for
both men and women, it was more pronounced for
the men. Moreover, the lower the income category,
the greater the gender difference. At the highest
How Gender Counts 297
income level, the mean appreciation felt by men and
women was similar (6.22 and 6.50, respectively). At
the lowest income level, men’smeanrating of spouses’
appreciation was 3.60, whereas women’s mean rating
was 5.65.
Next, we conducted a 2 (gender) × 3 (spouse
income category) between-groups analysis of variance
on participants’ feelings of gratitude toward
their spouses for the spouses’ earnings. The analysis
revealed only one significant effect: a main effect
for spouse income category, F(2, 194) = 8.54, p <
.001. Regardless of gender, the more money spouses
earned, the more grateful participants felt for
their incomes. The means for the three ascending
income categories were 6.22, 6.61, and 6.69,
respectively.
Two additional analyses of variance were conducted,
in which we substituted spouse income for
participant income in the previous analyses and vice
versa. These analyses showed that spouse income was
not significantly associated with how appreciated participants
felt by spouses, nor was participant income
significantly related to how grateful participants felt.
Thus, feeling appreciated by a spouse for one’s earnings
is associated with how much money one makes,
whereas feeling grateful to a spouse depends on how
much money the spouse earns.
Participants’ Feelings About Their Incomes
Separate 2 (gender) × 3 (participant income category)
analyses of variance were conducted on the
extent to which participants felt happy, frustrated,
embarrassed, and proud about their incomes. There
were significant main effects for both gender and
earning category for each measure. Men expressed
stronger feelings thanwomenon both the positive and
negative measures. They were happier (Ms = 6.01
and 5.87, respectively), F(1, 191) = 3.91, p < .05,
more frustrated (Ms = 2.61 and 2.53, respectively),
F(1, 191) = 5.22, p < .05, more embarrassed (Ms =
1.54 and 1.35, respectively), F(1, 191) = 7.32, p <
.01, and prouder (Ms = 1.54 and 1.35, respectively),
F(1, 191) = 4.72, p < .11, of their incomes
than women were. Figure 2 illustrates that regardless
of gender, high earners were happier, F(2, 191) =
18.25, p < .001, and prouder, F(2, 191) = 11.97, p <
.001, than low earners, whereas low earners were
more frustrated, F(2, 191) = 10.70, p < .001, and
embarrassed, F(2, 191) = 6.25, p < .01, than high
earners.
In analyses of covariance, we also examined gender
differences on happiness, frustration, embarrassment,
and pride while controlling for actual income
(rather than income category).When income was controlled
this way, the only significant gender difference
that remained was in embarrassment, F(1, 117) =
3.9, p < .05. Men were more embarrassed by their incomes
than women were (AdjustedMs 1.64 and 1.34,
respectively).
Relative Income
No evidence suggests that spouses or others are
disapproving when wives earn high incomes. In fact,
in the three highest income groups about 2/3 of the
women report praise from someone. However, it is
possible that wives’ high incomes are seen as problematic
only when they exceed husbands’ incomes.
To test this possibility, we compared men and women
who outearned their spouses on the three praise variables.
In each case women were more likely to report
praise when they outearned their husbands than
husbands were when they outearned their wives, but
none of the chi-squares were significant. Chi-squares
also showed that women who outearned their husbands
were not significantly more likely to report criticism
for earnings than were men who outearned their
wives.
The original relative income variable was based
on the participants’ reports of whether they earned
more, the same, or less than their spouses. However,
we discovered that the answer to that question was
gendered. The “earns the same” category was particularly
problematic because on average, men who
reported that they earned the same as their wives,
actually earned $7,550 less than their wives, whereas
women who reported equal incomes actually earned
only $2,208 less than their husbands. Men may avoid
the self-perception that they are outearned by their
wives by claiming equality more readily than women
do with the same income differential.Thus, for further
analyses of the effects of relative income, we created a
new variable: the percentage of family income earned
by the participant. This variable was calculated from
participants’ reports of their own incomes and their
spouses’ incomes. As mentioned earlier, only 120 of
the 214 participants provided this precise income information.
Thus, the findings should be treated with
caution.

participants between participant’s earnings, percentage
of family income earned, spouse’s earnings, and
feeling appreciated by spouse for earnings; feeling
grateful to spouse for spouse income, and happiness,
frustration, embarrassment, and pride with their
own earnings. Interesting differences in the pattern
of correlations emerged. For women, percentage
of family income earned was negatively correlated
with gratitude toward spouse, r = −.39, p <
.01, but was not significantly correlated with feeling
appreciated or with any of the feelings about
their own incomes (i.e., happiness, frustration, pride,
embarrassment). For men, percentage of family income
earned was positively correlated with feeling appreciated,
r = .35, p < .01, but not significantly correlated
with gratitude or with any of the feelings
about income variables. However, for both women
and men, the more appreciated they felt by their
spouses for their earnings, the happier (r = .58, p <
.01, r = .41, p < .01, respectively), less embarrassed
(r = −.30, p < .01, r = −.28, p < .01, respectively),
and prouder (r = .63, p < .01, r = .59, p < .01, respectively)
they felt about those earnings. Women
also felt less frustrated by their earnings the more
appreciated they were by their husbands, r = −.34,
p < .01.
Thus, the greater the percentage of the family income
husbands earn, the more husbands feel appreciated
and the more wives feel grateful. In contrast,
when women’s share of the family income increases,
men do not feel more grateful than other men nor do
women feel more appreciated for their incomes than
other women do. Because actual income and relative
income are highly correlated, it is not entirely possible
to disentangle the independent effects of each,
but some of the patterns are suggestive. For example,
although women’s gratitude for their husbands’
incomes is significantly correlated with the percentage
of family income that husbands earn, r = .39, p <
.01, it is not significantly correlated with husbands’

actual income (r = .13).7 In contrast, men’s gratitude
for their wives’ incomes is significantly correlated
with wives’ actual incomes, r = .28, p < .05, but not
with the percentage of family income that wives earn,
r = .17.8 Taken together, these findings suggest that
men’s and women’s incomes are not treated in exactly
the same way. Men’s incomes are appreciated more as
a function of their relative than their actual contribution
probably because a greater relative contribution
reflects the provider role. Men are appreciated not
so much for earning money, as for being providers.
Women’s incomes are appreciated for what they add
to the family fortunes, but not when their increasing
share of the family income threatens to turn them into
providers.
Nonetheless, these findings do not necessarily
imply that women are penalized for outearning
their husbands. When we compared men and
women who earned more than 50% of the income
in their families, outearning women tended to feel
more appreciated than did outearning men (M =
6.56 vs. M = 6.05), t(44) = 1.70, p < .11, and they
did not feel less happy, more frustrated, more embarrassed,
or less proud than their male counterparts.

7Because women’s work hours are significantly correlated to the
percentage of family income earned, r = .37, p < .01, we thought
that women might be grateful to their husbands because they
didn’t work as much rather than because of husbands’ greater
earnings. However, even after we controlled for women’s work
hours, their gratitude for husbands’ incomes was significantly correlated
to the percentage of family income earned by those husbands,
r = .39, p < .01. Moreover, women’s work hours were not
at all correlated with gratitude to husbands for their earnings,
r = −.04.
8To illustrate that the pattern of correlations differs for men and
women, we ran two regressions: the first in which gratitude for
spouse’s income was regressed on actual income, sex, and the
interaction term for the two, the second in which gratitude for
spouse’s income was regressed on relative income, sex, and the
interaction term for those two. In the first equation, the t value for
the interaction term is –1.34, whereas in the second, the t value
for the interaction term is 1.16. The different signs for the t values
of the interaction term in the two equations show that gratitude is
associated differently with actual and relative income, depending
on the gender of the participant.
9This finding is based on the 46 participants (37 men and 9 women)
who reported income information for both themselves and the
spouses whom they outearned. When we compared participants
based on their self-reports of relative earning, which included 89
participants (71 men and 18 women) who said they outearned
their spouses, the results were consistent.Women who outearned
their husbands felt more appreciated by them (M = 6.78) than
did men who outearned their wives (M = 6.14), t(87) = 2.25,
p < .001.
Parenting
Chi-squares were calculated to compare the
praise and criticism reported by men and women,
and they showed that men were no more likely
than their wives to receive praise or criticism for
parenting, either from spouses or from people outside
their immediate family.10 Unlike previous research,
we did not observe a double standard of
praise that favored fathers. In fact, t-tests calculated
to compare men and women showed that
women felt more appreciated (M = 6.29) than men
(M = 5.72) for their parenting, t(212) = 3.54, p <
.001. Likewise, men felt more grateful (M = 6.47)
for their wives’ parenting than women felt for their
husbands’ (M = 5.91), t(212) = 3.61, p < .001. We
can’t conclude, however, that a double standard
that favors women is operating. Women may earn
more gratitude and feel more appreciated, not simply
because they are women, but because they
contribute more parenting than men do. In fact,
when spouses’ percentage of parenting was controlled
(as a covariate), the gender difference in
gratitude felt for parenting disappeared. Men usually
feel more grateful to their wives than wives
do to their husbands, because men have more to
be grateful for when it comes to parenting. Paradoxically,
however, we found that even when we
controlled for percentage of parenting (as a covariate),
although we know the actual gratitude felt by
spouses was the same, women felt more appreciated
than men did for their parenting, F(1, 210) = 3.88,
p < .05.
To explore further possible gender differences
in spouses’ exchange of gratitude for parenting, we
examined the relation between the percentage of
parenting contributed by men and women and how
much they felt appreciated by and grateful to spouses
(see Table I). Women were more grateful to husbands
who contributed a greater percentage of parenting,
r = .46, p < .01, and as husbands did relatively
more, they themselves felt more appreciated
as parents, r = .27, p < .01. In contrast, when women
contributed relatively more of the parenting, men
were not significantly more grateful, r = .19, p > .10,
nor did those women feel more appreciated for their
parenting, r = −.12, p > .10.
10Even when we compared only the men and women who claimed
to share childcare equally, there was no difference in the praise
they reported for their parenting.
How Gender Counts 301
The Relation Between Parenting and Earning
Husbands and wives contributed to the family by
both paid labor and domestic labor. Consistent with
other findings, the more money earned by both men
and women, the lower their percentage contributions
to parenting (r = −.37 and r = −.33, respectively,
ps < .01), even when work hours were controlled.
Likewise, the higher the relative income of participants,
the lower their percentage contributions to parenting,
although the relation was significant for men,
r = −.46, p < .001, but not for women,r = −.24, p >
.05. Because parenting and income earned appear to
trade off as contributions, one might think that gratitude
for a spouse’s income mediates the relationship
between income earned and parenting. That is, a participant
who earns relatively less than a spouse might
express gratitude by doing relatively more parenting.
However, our analyses did not bear this out. Gratitude
for the spouse’s income was related to the percentage
of men’s parenting, r = .34, p < .01, but not to the
percentage of women’s parenting, r = −.13, p > .05.
When we controlled for gratitude for spouse’s income
in partial correlations, relative income was still
negatively correlated with percentage of parenting
for both men, r = −.43, p < .001, and for women,
r = −.29, p < .05.
DISCUSSION
Gender certainly still counts when people count
their money. First, men and women feel differently
about the money they earn. Second, women are
praised more than men for earning money, although
on average they earn less money than men do.
Third, women feel more appreciation from husbands
for earning income than husbands feel from wives.
Fourth, men’s and women’s absolute and relative incomes
affect the economy of gratitude differently. Finally,
the relation between income earned and parenting
doesn’t work the same way for men and women.
Men have stronger negative and stronger positive
feelings about their incomes than women do. It
is not surprising that men feel more positively about
the money they earn because they do earn more than
women. However, if money were gender neutral, we
would expect that women would be more embarrassed
about their incomes, given that they earn less
than men. That’s not the case. The link between masculinity
and money seems to leave men more vulnerable
to feelings of embarrassment than women
are. As in previous research, these findings suggest
that men’s identities and senses of self-worth are tied
to their earnings either because the earnings reflect
their work-related success or their ability to provide
for their families (Deutsch, 1999). Likewise, although
Willinger’s decade-long study (Willinger, 1993) of
changing gender attitudes showed that college-aged
men seemed to become more accepting of women’s
work roles, they showed no change in the importance
of their own work roles. Breadwinning remains
a way of doing gender for which men hold themselves
accountable.
We uncovered a double standard of praise in
which women appear to get special recognition for
doing what men do routinely, that is, earning money.
Consistent with theory and research on shifting standards,
women don’t have to earn as much as men to
get praised for earning money (Biernat et al., 1991).
Women also reported feeling more appreciated by
spouses for their earnings than men did.
These findings contradict earlier researchondouble
standards for men and women, which showed that
mention ofwomen’s earnings, in contrast to men’s parenting,
did not receive explicit praise (Deutsch, 1999;
Deutsch & Saxon, 1998). The discrepancy between
our findings and previous research could be due to differences
in the methodology. In the earlier qualitative
research, participants were asked if they had ever received
praise and criticism for their roles in the family,
whereas in the current study participants were explicitly
asked whether they had been praised or criticized
for their earnings. Perhaps in the earlier work, participants
didn’t consider praise for earnings an example
of praise for family roles. However, given that the previous
research was conducted in 1990 (Deutsch, 1999;
Deutsch & Saxon, 1998), we believe that the difference
more likely reflects a change in attitudes over
the last decade.
Consistent with this interpretation of change
over time, we failed to replicate the double standard
of praise for parenting that was shown in earlier research
(Deutsch, 1999; Deutsch & Saxon, 1998). Men
did not report more praise than women for parenting,
even when we restricted the analysis to couples who
shared parenting equally.
At first glance, it appears that we found a double
standard of appreciation for earnings inside the
family.Women reported feeling more appreciated by
their spouses for the money they earned than men did.
Given that women feel more appreciated by spouses
than men do, we would expect men to express more
gratitude toward wives than wives express toward
302 Deutsch, Roksa, and Meeske
husbands.Yet, men are no more likely than women to
express gratitude for their spouses’ financial contributions
to the family. Moreover, women also feel more
appreciated than men do for parenting. Yet, no gender
difference in the gratitude expressed for spouses’
parenting was evident, when the percentage of parenting
was taken into account. Furthermore, whereas
women might be especially appreciated for earnings
that are unexpected, it is unclearwhywomenwould be
especially appreciated for parenting, which is a more
routine component of gendered family roles.
Perhaps women are simply more inclined to give
husbands the benefit of the doubt, and thus, overestimate
their husbands’ gratitude. Winquist, Mohr,
and Kenny (1998) recently showed that women make
more favorable judgments of others than do men. Although
their work focused on trait ratings, this “female
positivity effect” may also extend to women’s
assignment of positive motives and intentions to others.
If so, because the female positivity effect has
been shown to be mediated by a gender-role orientation,
perhaps only the women with traditional genderrole
orientations feel especially appreciated by their
husbands.
Nonetheless, what counts as a gift deserving of
gratitude does depend on gender (Hochschild, 1989).
Women are grateful to their husbands as a function
of the proportion of money and the proportion of
parenting those husbands contribute to the family,
whereas men are grateful to their wives as a function
of the absolute amount of money the wives
earn and for the parenting wives do regardless of
the proportion. This pattern of gratitude for earnings
suggests that the responsibility for family earnings,
rather than the earnings themselves, is what women
want from their husbands. In contrast, men want their
wives to make money, but are not especially grateful if
wives’ incomes threaten to usurp men’s provider role.
Breadwinning still appears to be an important component
in men’s family roles and a critical component of
doing gender (Crowley, 1998; Zuo, 1997). Yet, paradoxically,
women’s greater gratitude toward husbands
who earn a higher proportion of the family income implies
that breadwinning, although prescribed for men,
may no longer be taken for granted.
Is women’s parenting taken for granted? Childcare
is still considered women’s responsibility, and
women may be held accountable if they don’t do a
disproportionate share of it. Willinger (1993) found
no change, for example, between 1980 and 1990 in
the percentage of college men who thought mothers
should stay home with a child if neither parent really
wanted to do so. Recently, Riggs (1997) found that
fathers who gave up financial security to care for children
met with disapproval, whereas mothers who did
the same thing were held in high regard. In our sample,
women certainly did a lot more childcare than their
husbands did.Women who do a higher proportion of
parenting than other women do not earn correspondingly
more gratitude from their husbands, whereas
men do receive more gratitude from their wives when
they contribute more than other men to parenting.
Nonetheless, women’s parenting does not seem to be
taken for granted. Men are highly grateful to their
wives for parenting (M = 6.47, SD = 0.89), regardless
of wives’ proportional contribution, which might
explain the absence of a correlation between that contribution
and husbands’ gratitude. Moreover, Pyke
(1994) found that women who switched from employment
to homemaking in second marriages sometimes
were rewarded with their husband’s gratitude and an
increased share of marital power.
Breadwinning appears to buy men out of childcare
to a greater extent than it does women. Previous
researchers have found a negative relationship
between domestic labor (usually housework) and income
(e.g., Hersch&Stratton, 1994; Kamo, 1988).We
also found that both men and women who made more
money did a smaller percentage of the family’s childcare,
even when work hours were taken into account.
But again, relative income mattered more for men
than for women.
A Dying Taboo?
Earning money only benefited women in this
study.Women did not seem to suffer any negative consequences
for high incomes. Just like men, the more
money women earned, the happier and prouder they
felt. And the more women earned, the more appreciated
they felt by their spouses and the more gratitude
their spouses expressed toward them.
Previous researchers have suggested that greater
earnings by wives than husbands were taboo. This
taboo leads women to hide their incomes, downplay
them, or compensate for them (Biernat & Wortman,
1991; Hochschild, 1989; Tichenor, 1999). In contrast,
the most striking finding of the current study, is that
women suffered no penalties we could discern when
they earned more than their husbands. Women were
proud of high incomes rather than being embarrassed
by them. Although husbands did not feel more gratitude
to wives who earned a greater proportion of
How Gender Counts 303
the family income, neither did they withhold gratitude
from those wives. Making money does not seem to violate
normative expectations for how women should
“do gender.”
Men, in contrast, did seem to be held accountable
as men, and suffer negative consequences when
their breadwinning status was in question. For example,
although men in all income categories felt less appreciated
for their earnings than women did, the difference
was most acute in the lowest income category.
Moreover, women were less grateful to husbands who
earned a relatively small share of the family income.
Small wonder that men were quick to categorize their
incomes as “equal” to their wives’.
The economy of gratitude provides a useful lens
to study both which resources are valued in the family
and how the value of those resources may be gendered.
Further work could usefully uncover the relation
of the exchange of gratitude to other marital
outcomes. For example, Pyke’s work shows how the
economy of gratitude in second marriages affects the
division of household labor and power sharing (Pyke,
1994; Pyke & Coltrane, 1996). In the current study,
both husbands and wives felt prouder and happier
about their incomes when they felt appreciated for
their earnings. Vogler (1998) argued that monetary
allocation systems in the family underwrite different
family power dynamics and reflect couples’ ideologies
of breadwinning, marital sharing, and ownership
of personal income. Gratitude may mediate how families
develop allocation systems.
Gratitude can also show how gender is being
done and undone in the family.That women’s incomes
evoke gratitude rather than resentment from their
husbands suggests that earning money is decreasing in
importance as a venue for “doing gender.” In bestowing
gratitude for earnings, husbands and wives appear
to be using the same standard.
Money is certainly not the only resource that
elicits gratitude and underwrites power in the family,
but it is an important resource. An optimistic person
might cautiously conclude that maybe women’s dollars
are finally starting to buy as much as men’s in the
family.
